# changed the engine fan blades working innner slats and flight deck color, fan doesnt dissappear on higher throttles 
# i used the a350 resources from FG  in the 777-300 and 777-300er. A very big thanks to the devs of the a350,
# I hope this makes the 777 model a bit more realistic, we will further try and remodel the 777 according to your pull requests
# thank you !
